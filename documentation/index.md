## (WIP) VitePress 📝💨

> [VuePress](http://vuepress.vuejs.org/)' little brother, built on top of [vite](https://github.com/vuejs/vite)

**Note this is early WIP! Currently the focus is on making Vite stable and feature complete first. It is not recommended to use this for anything serious yet.**

``` bash
npm install -D vitepress
echo '# Hello VitePress' > index.md

# starts dev server
npx vitepress

# build > .vitepress/dist
npx vitepress build
```
